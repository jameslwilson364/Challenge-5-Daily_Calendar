# Challenge-4-Wilson-Daily-Calendar

## Daily Calendar

The challenge for week 5 was to dynamically update a calendar on an existing html page.

- What was your motivation? This was challenging, using jquery to reconstruct the entire calendar in a dynamic loop was interesting.
- Why did you build this project? It was an interesting challenge to use JS to build the calendar rather than framing the calendar in the index.html file
- What problem does it solve? The webpages will provide a functional calendar that will allow entered events in each of the 9 hour blocks to save to local storage
- What did you learn? A ton to be honest. Nesting for loops was an interesting take away and event handlers that recognized specific buttons on the dynamically created page.

The main portions of the page that intended.

- Current date on the top of the page
- the nested for loops in the scheduleForm function dynamically creates the time blocks and all underlying content
- save buttons for each time block that store the user's entries into local storage

## Installation
